//! The solver-facing theory interface for DPLL(T).
//!
//! A [`Theory`] tracks the theory atoms whose boolean literals the SAT solver assigns, reports
//! theory conflicts (as clauses to learn), propagates theory-implied literals, explains them
//! lazily, and supports `push`/`pop` aligned with the solver's decision levels. One trait,
//! incremental and propagating — no `FullLazy`/`LessLazy` split.
